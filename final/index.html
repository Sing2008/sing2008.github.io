		<h1>Welcome to Vamshi's Speech and Debate Journey</h1>
		<p>Hi! My name is Vamshi Krishna Singari. I am the event leader for Commentary, Extemp, and Impromptu speaking on the North Allegheny Speech and Debate team. 
		I'm excited to share my experiences competing in Speech and Debate. 
		This site is a journey through the three unique events I compete in — Extemp, Impromptu, and Commentary — and a look into the unforgettable memories I’ve made along the way.

			<h1>Background & My Advice</h1>
			<p>
			When I first stepped foot into high school I had no idea what clubs and activities I wanted to partake in.
			In 9th grade, I entered high school with no plan for extracurriculars and didn't even know about Speech and Debate.
			I won once—and only once—in 9th grade, the novice tournament, and the rest of the year, nothing: not semis or finals.
			The desire to give up and quit was so high. With each tournament that passed, I wondered—maybe I am not cut out for this.
			I truthfully didn't have any committed Impromptu event leader, just Extemp kids trying their best to teach me.
			In the beginning of 10th grade, I thought about it for a while—should I quit?
			But I powered through, finding my own style not just for Impromptu, but for Extemp and Commentary too.
			I taught other students as they didn't have any official event leader to go to. The advice I give very student from then on is "BE CONFIDENT" wether you are right or wrong.
